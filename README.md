# Pusher Flutter Client
An unofficial Flutter plugin that wraps [pusher-websocket-java](https://github.com/pusher/pusher-websocket-java) on Android and [pusher-websocket-swift](https://github.com/pusher/pusher-websocket-swift) on iOS.

Get it from [pub](https://pub.dev/packages/pusher_websocket_flutter).
# How to install
* Add to your pubspec.yaml
```
dependencies:
  pusher_websocket_flutter: ^0.1.1
```
* In `/ios/Podfile`, set global platform to at least 9.0
`platform :ios, '9.0'`
### For iOS Objective-C based Flutter apps
It is currently a bit difficult to get some Swift based Flutter plugins working in an Objective-C based Flutter app. See [here for info](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/25676) and [here for a way to fix](https://github.com/fayeed/flutter_freshchat/issues/9#issuecomment-514329934).

This set of steps should work to fix this for your project.
* Add `use_frameworks!` to the end of the Runner section in `/ios/Podfile`
* Set Swift version in your iOS Runner project.
    * Open the project with Xcode.
    * In Runner, File -> New -> File -> Swift File. Name it anything.
    * Xcode will ask you if you wish to create Bridging Header, click yes.
    * Go to Runner `Build Settings` and set `SWIFT_VERSION` to either 4.2 or 5.0
    * Delete the Swift file created in step 2
    * Delete the Bridging Header created in step 3
* `flutter clean`
* In /ios `pod install --repo-update`

|*cluster*        |`String`     |*Optional* - The identifier of the cluster your application was created in. When not supplied, will connect to the `mt1`(`us-east-1`) cluster.|
|*host*           |`String`     |*Optional* - Provide your own (websocket) host instead of the default `ws.pusherapp.com`|
|*port*           |`int`        |*Optional* - Provide your own (websocket) port instead of the default `443` (when encryption is enabled) or port `80` (when encryption is disabled).|
